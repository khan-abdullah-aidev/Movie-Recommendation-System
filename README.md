# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Collaborative Filtering)

A simple **movie recommendation engine** built using **NumPy** and the concept of **collaborative filtering**.  
This project was created as part of my journey in learning **Data Science & AI** during my BCA studies.

## 🚀 Features
- Calculates **cosine similarity** between users  
- Predicts user preferences for unrated movies  
- Provides recommendations automatically  
- Beginner-friendly & lightweight implementation

## 📊 Example Output
Cosine Similarity Matrix:
[[1. 0.97560976 0. 0. 0.6097561 ]
[0.97560976 1. 0. 0. 0.48780488]
[0. 0. 1. 0.97560976 0.48780488]
[0. 0. 0.97560976 1. 0.3902439 ]
[0.6097561 0.48780488 0.48780488 0.3902439 1. ]]

User1's predicted scores: [0. 0. 4. 0.]
Recommended movie for User1: Movie 3

## 🧠 Learning Focus

This project is not about production-ready systems, but about grasping fundamentals:

- NumPy operations

- Cosine similarity

- Collaborative filtering basics

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

- Add Pandas + Matplotlib for better data handling & visualization

- Expand dataset beyond toy example

- Experiment with real-world datasets (MovieLens, Kaggle)

## ✨ About Me

I’m currently pursuing BCA (specialization in Data Science) and sharing my learning journey through projects.
This repo marks one of my first ML-inspired builds 🚀
